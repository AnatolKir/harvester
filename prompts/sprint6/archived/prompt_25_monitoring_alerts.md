# Configure Monitoring and Alerts

## Objective

Set up comprehensive monitoring, metrics collection, and alerting for the MCP Gateway to ensure operational visibility and proactive issue detection.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_24_zero_downtime.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/monitoring/`

## Task

Implement production monitoring infrastructure with metrics collection, dashboards, and automated alerting for the MCP Gateway service.

### Requirements

1. Monitoring integration:
   - Railway's built-in monitoring
   - Custom metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)
   - Log aggregation and analysis
   - Performance monitoring
2. Key metrics to monitor:

   ```
   # Service Health
   - Service uptime/availability
   - Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
   - Error rate by endpoint
   - Health check success rate

   # MCP Gateway Specific
   - Tool execution success rate
   - BrightData API call latency
   - Circuit breaker state changes
   - Cache hit/miss ratios

   # System Resources
   - Memory usage
   - CPU utilization
   - Network I/O
   - Connection pool utilization
   ```

3. Alerting rules:
   - **Critical**: Service down, high error rate (>5%)
   - **Warning**: High latency (>2s p95), circuit breaker open
   - **Info**: Deployment events, configuration changes
4. Alert channels:
   - Email notifications
   - Slack integration (if available)
   - Railway dashboard notifications
5. Monitoring dashboard:
   - Service overview (uptime, requests, errors)
   - Performance metrics (latency, throughput)
   - Business metrics (domains discovered, tool usage)
   - System health (resources, dependencies)

### Monitoring Configuration

**Health Monitoring**:

- Continuous health check monitoring
- Dependency health tracking (BrightData, Redis)
- Service availability SLA tracking

**Performance Monitoring**:

- Request/response time tracking
- Tool execution performance
- Resource utilization trends

**Business Monitoring**:

- Tool usage patterns
- Domain discovery rates
- API quota consumption

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review monitoring strategies for MCP services
- Suggest key performance indicators to track
- Validate alerting thresholds and escalation
- Guide on operational dashboard design

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive metrics collection active
- [ ] Critical alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard provides operational visibility
- [ ] Alert noise minimized (low false positive rate)
- [ ] Performance trends tracked over time
- [ ] Team trained on monitoring and alerting

## Notes

- Start with essential alerts, expand based on operational needs
- Test alert channels to ensure delivery
- Document alert response procedures
- Consider alert fatigue prevention strategies
