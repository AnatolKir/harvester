# Troubleshooting Guide

## Objective

Create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for the MCP Gateway to help operators diagnose and resolve common issues quickly.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_26_api_documentation.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/docs/troubleshooting.md`

## Task

Develop detailed troubleshooting documentation that covers common issues, diagnostic procedures, and resolution steps for the MCP Gateway.

### Requirements

1. Create `docs/troubleshooting.md` with structured troubleshooting guide:
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Diagnostic procedures
   - Log analysis guidance
   - Performance troubleshooting
   - Emergency procedures
2. Issue categories:

   ```markdown
   ## Connection Issues

   - BrightData connection failures
   - Network connectivity problems
   - Authentication errors

   ## Performance Issues

   - High response times
   - Memory leaks
   - Circuit breaker activation

   ## Tool Execution Issues

   - Tool call failures
   - Parameter validation errors
   - Rate limiting problems

   ## System Issues

   - Service startup failures
   - Health check failures
   - Resource exhaustion
   ```

3. Diagnostic procedures:
   - Health check interpretation
   - Log analysis techniques
   - Metrics interpretation
   - Network connectivity testing
   - BrightData service validation
4. Troubleshooting templates:

   ```markdown
   ### Issue: High Response Times

   **Symptoms:**

   - Response times > 2 seconds
   - Client timeouts
   - Poor user experience

   **Diagnostic Steps:**

   1. Check `/metrics` endpoint for latency percentiles
   2. Review BrightData API response times
   3. Analyze cache hit rates
   4. Check circuit breaker status

   **Common Causes:**

   - BrightData API latency
   - Cache misses
   - Network issues
   - Resource constraints

   **Resolution Steps:**

   1. Check BrightData service status
   2. Verify cache configuration
   3. Scale resources if needed
   4. Contact BrightData support if API issues persist
   ```

5. Emergency procedures:
   - Service restart procedures
   - Rollback instructions
   - Escalation contacts
   - Incident response checklist

### Troubleshooting Tools

**Diagnostic Commands**:

- Health check validation
- Log tail and analysis
- Metrics queries
- Network connectivity tests

**Monitoring Integration**:

- Alert correlation
- Dashboard interpretation
- Trend analysis

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review troubleshooting guide structure
- Suggest common MCP service issues
- Validate diagnostic procedures
- Guide on operational best practices

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive issue coverage
- [ ] Clear diagnostic procedures
- [ ] Actionable resolution steps
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented
- [ ] Team can resolve common issues independently
- [ ] Guide tested with real scenarios

## Notes

- Include actual log examples and their interpretations
- Provide command-line tools for common diagnostics
- Keep guide updated as new issues are discovered
- Consider creating video walkthroughs for complex procedures
