# Runbook for Operations

## Objective

Create a comprehensive operations runbook for the MCP Gateway that provides step-by-step procedures for common operational tasks and incident response.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_28_architecture_diagrams.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/docs/runbook.md`

## Task

Develop detailed operational procedures that enable team members to effectively manage, maintain, and troubleshoot the MCP Gateway in production.

### Requirements

1. Create `docs/runbook.md` with operational procedures:
   - Daily operations checklist
   - Incident response procedures
   - Maintenance tasks
   - Emergency procedures
   - Escalation guidelines
2. Operational procedures:

   ```markdown
   ## Daily Operations

   ### Health Check Routine

   1. Verify service health: `curl https://gateway.domain.com/health`
   2. Check metrics dashboard for anomalies
   3. Review error rates and response times
   4. Validate BrightData connectivity

   ### Performance Monitoring

   1. Check tool execution success rates
   2. Monitor cache hit ratios
   3. Review circuit breaker status
   4. Verify resource utilization

   ## Incident Response

   ### Service Down (Priority: P0)

   1. Check Railway service status
   2. Review recent deployments
   3. Check health endpoint response
   4. Review application logs
   5. Escalate to engineering if needed

   ### High Error Rate (Priority: P1)

   1. Identify error patterns in logs
   2. Check BrightData service status
   3. Review circuit breaker states
   4. Check rate limiting metrics
   5. Consider temporary rate limit adjustment
   ```

3. Maintenance procedures:
   - Deployment procedures
   - Configuration updates
   - Credential rotation
   - Performance optimization
   - Capacity planning
4. Emergency procedures:
   - Service restart steps
   - Rollback procedures
   - Circuit breaker manual control
   - Emergency contacts
   - Communication templates
5. Monitoring and alerting:
   - Alert interpretation guide
   - Dashboard usage instructions
   - Log analysis procedures
   - Metric correlation techniques

### Runbook Sections

**Standard Operating Procedures**:

- Service startup/shutdown
- Health monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Configuration management

**Incident Response**:

- Severity classification
- Response procedures by incident type
- Escalation matrix
- Post-incident review process

**Maintenance Tasks**:

- Regular health checks
- Performance tuning
- Security updates
- Capacity planning

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review operations runbook best practices
- Suggest comprehensive operational procedures
- Validate incident response workflows
- Guide on operational excellence patterns

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete operational procedures documented
- [ ] Incident response workflows clearly defined
- [ ] Emergency procedures tested and validated
- [ ] Team trained on runbook procedures
- [ ] Escalation paths clearly documented
- [ ] Regular maintenance tasks scheduled

## Notes

- Include actual command examples and expected outputs
- Provide decision trees for complex troubleshooting
- Keep contact information current
- Review and update runbook regularly based on incidents
