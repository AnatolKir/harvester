# Add Session Management

## Objective

Implement session management for the MCP Gateway to maintain persistent connections and state across multiple tool calls.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_07_comments_page_tool.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/src/session-manager.ts`

## Task

Create a session management system that efficiently handles multiple concurrent requests and maintains connection state with BrightData's service.

### Requirements

1. Create `src/session-manager.ts` with session handling logic
2. Session management features:
   - Session pooling for concurrent requests
   - Connection reuse to minimize overhead
   - Session timeout and cleanup
   - Request queuing and load balancing
3. Session lifecycle:
   - Create session on first request
   - Reuse sessions for subsequent requests
   - Clean up idle sessions after timeout
   - Handle session failures gracefully
4. Implementation components:

   ```typescript
   class SessionManager {
     createSession(userId?: string): Session;
     getSession(sessionId: string): Session;
     releaseSession(sessionId: string): void;
     cleanupExpiredSessions(): void;
   }

   class Session {
     id: string;
     mcpClient: MCPClient;
     lastUsed: Date;
     isActive: boolean;
   }
   ```

5. Configuration options:
   - Maximum concurrent sessions (default: 10)
   - Session timeout (default: 30 minutes)
   - Connection pool size per session
   - Request queue limits

### Session Features

- Support for both authenticated and anonymous sessions
- Request correlation for debugging
- Metrics collection for monitoring
- Circuit breaker integration

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review session management patterns for MCP services
- Suggest connection pooling strategies
- Validate session security and isolation
- Guide on BrightData-specific session requirements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Sessions are created and managed efficiently
- [ ] Multiple concurrent requests handled properly
- [ ] Session cleanup prevents memory leaks
- [ ] Connection reuse improves performance
- [ ] Failed sessions are recovered automatically
- [ ] Session metrics available for monitoring

## Notes

- Keep session state minimal and stateless where possible
- Implement proper locking for concurrent access
- Consider session affinity for related requests
- Plan for horizontal scaling (sessions per instance)
