# Team Training Materials

## Objective

Create comprehensive training materials to onboard team members on the MCP Gateway system, operations, and troubleshooting procedures.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_29_operations_runbook.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/docs/training/`

## Task

Develop training materials that enable team members to effectively operate, monitor, and troubleshoot the MCP Gateway in production.

### Requirements

1. Create training directory structure:
   ```
   docs/training/
   ├── overview.md           # System overview and architecture
   ├── operations.md         # Day-to-day operations
   ├── troubleshooting.md    # Troubleshooting scenarios
   ├── incident-response.md  # Incident response procedures
   └── exercises/           # Hands-on exercises
       ├── health-check.md
       ├── tool-testing.md
       └── incident-simulation.md
   ```
2. Training modules:
   **Module 1: System Overview**
   - MCP Gateway purpose and architecture
   - Integration with domain harvesting pipeline
   - Key components and their roles
   - BrightData integration patterns

   **Module 2: Operations**
   - Daily monitoring procedures
   - Health check interpretation
   - Performance monitoring
   - Dashboard usage

   **Module 3: Troubleshooting**
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Log analysis techniques
   - Diagnostic procedures
   - When to escalate

   **Module 4: Incident Response**
   - Incident classification
   - Response procedures
   - Communication protocols
   - Post-incident review

3. Hands-on exercises:

   ```markdown
   ## Exercise 1: Health Check Analysis

   **Scenario**: You receive an alert that the health check is failing.

   **Steps**:

   1. Access the health endpoint: `curl https://gateway.domain.com/health`
   2. Analyze the response
   3. Check the logs for errors
   4. Determine if this is a real issue or false positive
   5. Document your findings

   **Expected Outcome**: Ability to quickly assess service health
   ```

4. Training assessments:
   - Knowledge check questions
   - Practical scenarios
   - Troubleshooting simulations
   - Certification criteria
5. Reference materials:
   - Quick reference cards
   - Command cheat sheets
   - Contact information
   - Links to monitoring dashboards

### Training Content

**Technical Training**:

- Review training material structure and content
- Suggest comprehensive training scenarios
- Validate technical accuracy of training content
- Guide on effective knowledge transfer strategies

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete training curriculum developed
- [ ] Hands-on exercises tested and validated
- [ ] Team members can independently operate the system
- [ ] Common troubleshooting scenarios covered
- [ ] Reference materials easily accessible
- [ ] Training materials maintainable and updatable

## Notes

- Include real examples from the system
- Create progressive training from basic to advanced
- Provide multiple learning formats (text, diagrams, exercises)
- Plan for regular training updates as system evolves
