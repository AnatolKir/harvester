# Implement Connection Pooling

## Objective

Add intelligent connection pooling to the MCP Gateway for efficient resource utilization and improved performance with BrightData's service.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_14_graceful_shutdown.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/src/connection-pool.ts`

## Task

Implement a connection pool manager that optimizes MCP connections to BrightData while handling connection lifecycle and failure recovery.

### Requirements

1. Create `src/connection-pool.ts` with pooling logic
2. Connection pool features:
   - Configurable pool size (min: 2, max: 10)
   - Connection health monitoring
   - Automatic connection recovery
   - Load balancing across connections
   - Connection reuse optimization
3. Pool configuration:
   ```typescript
   interface PoolConfig {
     minConnections: number; // 2
     maxConnections: number; // 10
     acquireTimeout: number; // 5000ms
     idleTimeout: number; // 300000ms (5min)
     maxRetries: number; // 3
   }
   ```
4. Pool implementation:

   ```typescript
   class ConnectionPool {
     async acquire(): Promise<MCPConnection>;
     release(connection: MCPConnection): void;
     async destroy(): Promise<void>;
     getStats(): PoolStats;
   }

   interface PoolStats {
     active: number;
     idle: number;
     pending: number;
     created: number;
     destroyed: number;
   }
   ```

5. Connection management:
   - Pre-warm connections on startup
   - Connection validation before use
   - Automatic replacement of failed connections
   - Connection aging and refresh

### Connection Pool Features

- Circuit breaker integration per connection
- Connection affinity for session management
- Pool metrics for monitoring
- Graceful pool shutdown
- Connection leak detection

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review connection pooling strategies for MCP services
- Suggest optimal pool sizing for BrightData
- Validate connection lifecycle management
- Guide on performance optimization

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Connection pool maintains optimal size
- [ ] Failed connections replaced automatically
- [ ] Pool performance improves request latency
- [ ] No connection leaks under load
- [ ] Pool statistics available for monitoring
- [ ] Graceful pool shutdown works correctly

## Notes

- Monitor connection pool efficiency metrics
- Implement connection warmup during startup
- Consider connection affinity for related requests
- Plan for dynamic pool sizing based on load
