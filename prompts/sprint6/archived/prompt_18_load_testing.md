# Load Testing Setup

## Objective

Create load testing infrastructure to validate MCP Gateway performance under concurrent load and identify bottlenecks.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_17_integration_tests.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/tests/load/`

## Task

Implement comprehensive load testing that simulates realistic usage patterns while respecting BrightData's rate limits and service constraints.

### Requirements

1. Create load testing setup:
   - `tests/load/load-test.js` (using k6 or Artillery)
   - `tests/load/scenarios/` directory for different test scenarios
   - `tests/load/config/` for environment-specific configs
2. Load testing scenarios:
   - **Baseline**: Single user, sequential requests
   - **Concurrent**: Multiple users, parallel requests
   - **Spike**: Sudden load increases
   - **Sustained**: Long-running steady load
3. Test configuration:
   - Virtual users: 5-20 (respect rate limits)
   - Duration: 5-10 minutes per scenario
   - Ramp-up: Gradual user increase
   - Think time: Realistic delays between requests
4. Load test structure:
   ```javascript
   // k6 example
   export let options = {
     scenarios: {
       concurrent_search: {
         executor: 'ramping-vus',
         startVUs: 1,
         stages: [
           { duration: '2m', target: 10 },
           { duration: '5m', target: 10 },
           { duration: '2m', target: 0 },
         ],
       },
     },
   };
   ```
5. Performance metrics:
   - Request rate (req/s)
   - Response time percentiles (p95, p99)
   - Error rate
   - Resource utilization
   - BrightData API latency

### Load Testing Features

- Realistic request patterns
- Rate limit compliance
- Performance threshold alerts
- Resource monitoring integration
- Automated performance regression detection

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review load testing strategies for MCP services
- Suggest appropriate load levels for BrightData integration
- Validate rate limiting compliance in tests
- Guide on performance benchmark establishment

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Load tests run without exceeding rate limits
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Bottlenecks identified and documented
- [ ] Gateway handles concurrent load gracefully
- [ ] Resource usage patterns understood
- [ ] Performance regression tests ready

## Notes

- Start with conservative load levels
- Monitor BrightData quota usage during tests
- Use staging environment for intensive load testing
- Document performance characteristics for capacity planning
