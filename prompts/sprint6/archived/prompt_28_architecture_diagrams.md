# Architecture Diagrams

## Objective

Create clear architecture diagrams and system documentation that illustrate the MCP Gateway's design, data flow, and integration patterns.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_27_troubleshooting_guide.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/docs/architecture.md`

## Task

Develop comprehensive architectural documentation with diagrams that explain the system design, component relationships, and operational flows.

### Requirements

1. Create `docs/architecture.md` with system architecture documentation:
   - High-level system overview
   - Component architecture
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Integration patterns
   - Deployment architecture
2. Architecture diagrams to create:

   ```
   ## System Overview
   [Client] -> [MCP Gateway] -> [BrightData MCP Service]
                  |                      |
               [Redis Cache]        [TikTok API]
                  |
               [Metrics/Logs]

   ## Component Architecture
   MCP Gateway:
   ├── HTTP Server (Express)
   ├── MCP Client
   ├── Tool Registry
   │   ├── tiktok.ccl.search
   │   └── tiktok.comments.page
   ├── Session Manager
   ├── Rate Limiter
   ├── Circuit Breaker
   └── Cache Manager

   ## Data Flow
   Request -> Validation -> Rate Limiting -> Cache Check
        -> Tool Execution -> Response Formatting -> Client
   ```

3. Documentation sections:
   - **Overview**: Purpose and goals
   - **Architecture**: System design principles
   - **Components**: Detailed component descriptions
   - **Data Flow**: Request/response lifecycle
   - **Integration**: External service integration
   - **Security**: Security considerations
   - **Scalability**: Scaling strategies
4. Diagram formats:
   - ASCII diagrams for simple flows
   - Mermaid diagrams for complex interactions
   - Consider generated diagrams from code
5. Technical specifications:
   - API contracts
   - Data formats
   - Protocol specifications
   - Performance characteristics

### Architecture Documentation

**System Context**:

- How MCP Gateway fits in domain harvesting pipeline
- External dependencies and integrations
- Service boundaries and responsibilities

**Technical Architecture**:

- Component interaction patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Performance and scalability design
- Security architecture

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review architecture documentation best practices
- Suggest diagram clarity improvements
- Validate technical accuracy of architectural descriptions
- Guide on system design documentation standards

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear system overview with visual diagrams
- [ ] Component relationships well documented
- [ ] Data flow clearly illustrated
- [ ] Integration patterns explained
- [ ] Technical specifications accurate
- [ ] Documentation accessible to technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Notes

- Use consistent notation and symbols across diagrams
- Include performance characteristics and constraints
- Keep diagrams synchronized with implementation
- Consider multiple abstraction levels for different audiences
