# Implement Zero-Downtime Deployment

## Objective

Implement zero-downtime deployment strategy for the MCP Gateway to ensure continuous service availability during updates.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_23_environment_variables.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/deploy/`, Railway configuration

## Task

Set up deployment processes and health checks that enable zero-downtime deployments with automatic rollback capabilities.

### Requirements

1. Health check enhancements:
   - Deep health checks for deployment readiness
   - Startup and readiness probes
   - Liveness checks during operation
   - Health check endpoints:
     - `GET /health` - Basic liveness
     - `GET /health/ready` - Readiness for traffic
     - `GET /health/startup` - Initial startup check
2. Deployment strategy:
   - Rolling deployment with health verification
   - Traffic shifting based on health status
   - Automatic rollback on health check failures
   - Pre-deployment validation
3. Implementation components:

   ```typescript
   class DeploymentHealthChecker {
     async checkStartup(): Promise<boolean>;
     async checkReadiness(): Promise<boolean>;
     async checkLiveness(): Promise<boolean>;
     getDeploymentStatus(): DeploymentStatus;
   }

   enum DeploymentStatus {
     STARTING = 'starting',
     READY = 'ready',
     DEGRADED = 'degraded',
     UNHEALTHY = 'unhealthy',
   }
   ```

4. Deployment validation:
   - Connection to BrightData verified before serving traffic
   - Database/cache connectivity confirmed
   - All critical services responsive
   - Performance baseline met
5. Rollback mechanisms:
   - Automatic rollback on health check failures
   - Manual rollback capability
   - State preservation during rollback
   - Notification of deployment status changes

### Zero-Downtime Features

- Graceful shutdown integration
- Request draining during deployment
- Health-based traffic routing
- Deployment status monitoring
- Automated recovery procedures

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review zero-downtime deployment patterns
- Suggest health check strategies for MCP services
- Validate rollback and recovery procedures
- Guide on deployment monitoring and alerting

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Deployments complete without service interruption
- [ ] Health checks accurately reflect service readiness
- [ ] Failed deployments rollback automatically
- [ ] Request success rate remains high during deployment
- [ ] Deployment status visible to operations team
- [ ] Manual rollback procedures documented

## Notes

- Test deployment procedures in staging environment
- Monitor deployment metrics closely
- Implement deployment canary testing if possible
- Document emergency procedures for deployment issues
