# Add Graceful Shutdown

## Objective

Implement graceful shutdown handling for the MCP Gateway to ensure clean termination and prevent data loss during deployments.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_13_metrics_endpoint.md
- Related files: `/mcp-gateway/src/shutdown.ts`

## Task

Create comprehensive shutdown handling that allows in-flight requests to complete while preventing new requests during termination.

### Requirements

1. Create `src/shutdown.ts` with shutdown orchestration logic
2. Shutdown sequence:
   - Stop accepting new requests (503 response)
   - Wait for in-flight requests to complete
   - Close MCP connections gracefully
   - Flush logs and metrics
   - Clean up resources and exit
3. Signal handling:
   - SIGTERM: Graceful shutdown (from deployment systems)
   - SIGINT: Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)
   - SIGUSR1: Reload configuration (optional)
4. Implementation components:
   ```typescript
   class ShutdownManager {
     async shutdown(signal: string): Promise<void>;
     registerHandler(handler: () => Promise<void>): void;
     isShuttingDown(): boolean;
     getActiveRequests(): number;
   }
   ```
5. Shutdown features:
   - Configurable shutdown timeout (default: 30 seconds)
   - Request tracking for in-flight monitoring
   - Resource cleanup callbacks
   - Shutdown status endpoint
   - Detailed shutdown logging

### Graceful Shutdown Flow

1. Receive shutdown signal
2. Set shutdown flag (reject new requests)
3. Wait for active requests (with timeout)
4. Close database/cache connections
5. Close MCP client connections
6. Flush logs and metrics
7. Exit process

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review graceful shutdown patterns for MCP services
- Suggest appropriate shutdown timeouts
- Validate resource cleanup strategies
- Guide on deployment integration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Graceful shutdown completes within timeout
- [ ] In-flight requests complete successfully
- [ ] New requests rejected with 503 during shutdown
- [ ] MCP connections closed cleanly
- [ ] No resource leaks during shutdown
- [ ] Shutdown process logged appropriately

## Notes

- Consider forceful shutdown after timeout expires
- Implement request draining for load balancer integration
- Test shutdown behavior with concurrent requests
- Plan for emergency shutdown procedures
