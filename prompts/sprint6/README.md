# Sprint 6: MCP Gateway Implementation

## Sprint Goal

Implement a production-ready MCP Gateway server to bridge the gap between our application's custom tool requirements and BrightData's MCP service, enabling reliable 24/7 domain harvesting operations.

## Context

During development, the system used a local MCP server on port 3333 with custom tools (`tiktok.ccl.search`, `tiktok.comments.page`). After upgrading to BrightData's paid plan, these custom tools are not available in the hosted service. This sprint implements an HTTP gateway that translates our custom tools to BrightData's standard tools.

## Architecture Decision

**Option 1: HTTP Gateway Server** was chosen for:

- Complete control over tool implementations
- Easy debugging with HTTP logs
- Vendor independence
- Caching capabilities
- Independent scaling
- Production reliability

## Deliverables

1. BrightData specialist agent for MCP expertise
2. MCP Gateway server with HTTP endpoints
3. Custom tool implementations (tiktok.ccl.search, tiktok.comments.page)
4. Railway deployment configuration
5. Health checks and monitoring
6. Comprehensive tests
7. Production documentation
8. Migration and rollback procedures

## Technical Components

- **Language**: Node.js/TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Deployment**: Railway (Docker)
- **Port**: 3333 (configurable)
- **Endpoints**: `/mcp`, `/health`, `/metrics`

## Sprint Structure

Each prompt is designed to:

- Focus on a single task to avoid context issues
- Invoke specialized agents when appropriate
- Include testing and documentation
- Build incrementally toward production readiness

## Success Criteria

- [ ] MCP Gateway server running on Railway
- [ ] Discovery job successfully finding videos
- [ ] Comments harvesting working
- [ ] Domain extraction pipeline functional
- [ ] Zero downtime deployment achieved
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Team trained on troubleshooting
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Risk Mitigation

- Implement circuit breakers for BrightData failures
- Add fallback to Playwright worker if needed
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Staged rollout with canary testing
- Backup configuration documented

## Timeline Estimate

- Development: 2-3 days
- Testing: 1 day
- Deployment: 0.5 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days
- **Total: 4-5 days**
