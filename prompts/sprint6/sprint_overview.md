# Sprint 6 Overview: MCP Gateway Implementation

## Sprint Goal

Implement a production-ready MCP Gateway server to bridge the gap between our application's custom tool requirements and BrightData's MCP service, enabling reliable 24/7 domain harvesting operations.

## Context

After upgrading to BrightData's paid plan, our custom tools (`tiktok.ccl.search`, `tiktok.comments.page`) are no longer available in the hosted service. This sprint implements an HTTP gateway that translates our custom tools to BrightData's standard tools.

## Architecture Decision

**HTTP Gateway Server** was chosen for complete control, easy debugging, vendor independence, caching capabilities, and production reliability.

## Sprint Structure

### Foundation (Prompts 01-05)

Establish the core MCP gateway infrastructure:

- 01: BrightData specialist agent validation
- 02: Project structure and TypeScript setup
- 03: Express server with middleware
- 04: MCP client connection to BrightData
- 05: Health check endpoints

### Tool Implementation (Prompts 06-10)

Implement custom tools and core features:

- 06: `tiktok.ccl.search` tool implementation
- 07: `tiktok.comments.page` tool implementation
- 08: Session management for connections
- 09: Rate limiting protection
- 10: Caching layer for performance

### Production Features (Prompts 11-15)

Add production reliability and monitoring:

- 11: Structured logging with Winston
- 12: Circuit breakers for failure handling
- 13: Metrics endpoint for monitoring
- 14: Graceful shutdown handling
- 15: Connection pooling optimization

### Testing (Prompts 16-20)

Comprehensive testing across all layers:

- 16: Unit tests for tools
- 17: Integration tests with BrightData
- 18: Load testing setup
- 19: Error scenario testing
- 20: End-to-end pipeline validation

### Deployment (Prompts 21-25)

Production deployment and operations:

- 21: Optimized Dockerfile
- 22: Railway deployment configuration
- 23: Environment variable management
- 24: Zero-downtime deployment
- 25: Monitoring and alerting setup

### Documentation (Prompts 26-30)

Complete documentation for operations:

- 26: API documentation with examples
- 27: Troubleshooting guide
- 28: Architecture diagrams
- 29: Operations runbook
- 30: Team training materials

## Success Criteria

- [ ] MCP Gateway server running on Railway
- [ ] Discovery job successfully finding videos
- [ ] Comments harvesting working
- [ ] Domain extraction pipeline functional
- [ ] Zero downtime deployment achieved
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Team trained on troubleshooting
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Technical Components

- **Language**: Node.js/TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Deployment**: Railway (Docker)
- **Port**: 3333 (configurable)
- **Endpoints**: `/mcp`, `/health`, `/metrics`

## Timeline Estimate

- Development: 2-3 days
- Testing: 1 day
- Deployment: 0.5 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days
- **Total: 4-5 days**

## Risk Mitigation

- Circuit breakers for BrightData failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Staged rollout with canary testing
- Fallback to Playwright worker if needed
- Backup configuration documented

## Dependencies

- BrightData MCP service access
- Railway deployment account
- Redis instance for caching/rate limiting
- Monitoring infrastructure

## Notes

- Each prompt designed for 10-15 minutes completion
- Invoke specialized agents proactively
- Test incrementally to catch issues early
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Maintain security best practices throughout
