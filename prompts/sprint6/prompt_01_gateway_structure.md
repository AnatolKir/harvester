# Initialize MCP Gateway Project Structure

## Objective

Create the foundational project structure for the MCP Gateway server with proper TypeScript configuration, dependencies, and development setup.

## Context

- Sprint: 6
- Dependencies: prompt_01_brightdata_agent.md
- Related files: New `/mcp-gateway/` directory

## Task

Set up a new Node.js/TypeScript project for the MCP Gateway server that will translate our custom tools to BrightData's standard MCP service.

### Requirements

1. Create `/mcp-gateway/` directory in project root
2. Initialize with `package.json` and proper dependencies:
   - Express.js for HTTP server
   - TypeScript and build tools
   - MCP SDK packages
   - Logging (winston)
   - Environment configuration (dotenv)
   - Testing framework (jest)
3. Configure TypeScript with strict settings
4. Set up development scripts (dev, build, test)
5. Create basic directory structure:
   ```
   /mcp-gateway/
     /src/
       /tools/
       /middleware/
       /types/
     /tests/
     /docker/
   ```

## Agent to Use

Invoke the **@brightdata** agent to:

- Review the project structure for MCP best practices
- Suggest appropriate dependencies for MCP integration
- Validate TypeScript configuration for MCP development

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `/mcp-gateway/` directory created with proper structure
- [ ] `package.json` with all required dependencies
- [ ] TypeScript configured with strict mode
- [ ] Development scripts working (npm run dev)
- [ ] Basic linting and formatting configured
- [ ] Git ignore file includes node_modules and build artifacts

## Notes

- Use Node.js 18+ for compatibility
- Ensure MCP SDK version matches BrightData's requirements
- Keep dependencies minimal but comprehensive
- Structure should support easy testing and deployment
