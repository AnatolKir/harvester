# Sprint 8: Integration Testing & Critical Fixes

## Sprint Goals

Fix critical issues discovered during integration testing to restore system functionality and meet MVP targets.

## Current System Status

**⚠️ SYSTEM DEGRADED (60% Operational)**

- Data pipeline stalled: 27 domains/week vs 200-500 target
- Test failure rate: 57% (critical schema mismatches)
- Worker endpoints returning 404 (not deployed)
- Multiple dev servers causing conflicts
- Inngest jobs registered but not executing

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. **Data Pipeline Stall** (Severity: Critical)
- Only 27 domains captured this week vs 200-500 target
- 86% below minimum viable performance
- Root cause: Job scheduling failures

### 2. **Schema Mismatches** (Severity: High)
- `video.description` vs `video.caption` field confusion
- Missing SQL views breaking UI queries
- 57% test failure rate

### 3. **Deployment Issues** (Severity: High)
- Worker `/discover` and `/harvest` endpoints return 404
- Railway deployment incomplete or misconfigured
- No proper health checks

### 4. **Development Environment** (Severity: Medium)
- Multiple npm dev processes running simultaneously
- Port conflicts and resource contention
- Unclear which server is active

### 5. **Job Scheduling** (Severity: Critical)
- Inngest jobs show "Registered" but never execute
- Discovery cron job not triggering
- No error logs or visibility into failures

## Success Criteria

By sprint completion:

- [ ] Data pipeline producing 200+ domains/week
- [ ] Test suite at 100% pass rate (0% failures)
- [ ] Worker endpoints deployed and responding
- [ ] Single clean dev environment
- [ ] Inngest jobs executing on schedule
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts operational
- [ ] All changes committed with clear history

## Sprint Execution Strategy

**Duration**: 2-3 days intensive fixes
**Approach**: Fix-first, then optimize
**Testing**: Validate each fix before proceeding

## Metrics Tracking

### Before Sprint 8
- Domains/week: 27 (86% below target)
- Test pass rate: 43%
- Worker uptime: 0% (404s)
- Dev environment: Fragmented
- Job execution: 0%

### Target After Sprint 8
- Domains/week: 200-500
- Test pass rate: 100%
- Worker uptime: 99%+
- Dev environment: Clean single instance
- Job execution: 100% on schedule

## Risk Mitigation

- Each prompt includes rollback procedures
- Commits after each successful fix
- Integration tests run after each change
- Manual validation of critical paths

## Success Dependencies

1. **Sequence matters**: Infrastructure fixes before data pipeline
2. **Testing critical**: Each fix must be validated
3. **Documentation**: Clear handoff notes between prompts
4. **Monitoring**: Health checks implemented throughout

## Post-Sprint Validation

Final verification checklist:
- [ ] Fresh discovery job completes successfully
- [ ] Comments harvested and domains extracted
- [ ] UI displays new domains correctly
- [ ] No error logs or warnings
- [ ] Performance meets MVP targets
