# Sprint 8: Integration Testing & Critical Fixes

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL SPRINT**: System is currently degraded at 60% operational status with multiple critical failures. This sprint focuses on emergency fixes to restore MVP functionality and meet performance targets.

## System Status

### Current State (60% Operational)
- **Data Pipeline**: STALLED - 27 domains/week vs 200-500 target (86% below minimum)
- **Test Suite**: FAILING - 57% failure rate due to schema mismatches  
- **Worker Endpoints**: DOWN - /discover and /harvest returning 404
- **Development Environment**: FRAGMENTED - 7+ npm processes running
- **Job Scheduling**: BROKEN - Inngest jobs registered but not executing

### Target State (100% Operational)
- **Data Pipeline**: 200+ domains/week extracted and processed
- **Test Suite**: 100% pass rate with stable integration tests
- **Worker Endpoints**: Deployed and responding with health checks
- **Development Environment**: Clean single dev server
- **Job Scheduling**: Cron jobs executing every 10 minutes reliably

## Critical Issues Analysis

### 1. Data Pipeline Stall (Severity: CRITICAL)
**Impact**: Primary business objective failing
- Current: 27 domains/week
- Target: 200-500 domains/week  
- Gap: 86% performance shortfall
- **Root Cause**: Inngest job scheduling completely broken

### 2. Schema Mismatches (Severity: HIGH)
**Impact**: 57% test failure rate, UI queries failing
- `video.description` vs `video.caption` field confusion
- Missing SQL views breaking dashboard
- API response shape mismatches
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent schema evolution

### 3. Worker Deployment (Severity: HIGH)  
**Impact**: Zero comment harvesting capability
- `/discover` endpoint returns 404
- `/harvest` endpoint returns 404
- Pipeline cannot process any videos
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete Railway deployment

### 4. Development Conflicts (Severity: MEDIUM)
**Impact**: Development efficiency and debugging
- Multiple npm dev processes competing
- Port conflicts and resource contention
- Unclear which server is active
- **Root Cause**: Poor process management

### 5. Job Execution (Severity: CRITICAL)
**Impact**: No automated data collection
- Inngest jobs show "Registered" but never run
- Discovery cron completely silent
- No error logs or failure visibility
- **Root Cause**: Configuration or connectivity issue

## Sprint Execution Plan

### Sequential Tasks (Critical Path)
Execute these in order - each depends on the previous:

1. **prompt_01_kill_duplicate_servers.md** - Clean development environment
2. **prompt_02_fix_schema_mismatches.md** - Restore database consistency  
3. **prompt_03_deploy_worker_endpoints.md** - Enable comment harvesting
4. **prompt_04_restart_data_pipeline.md** - Restore job scheduling

### Parallel Group A (After Task 4)
Can run simultaneously in separate windows:

5. **prompt_05_validate_domain_extraction.md** - Quality assurance
6. **prompt_06_setup_monitoring_alerts.md** - Prevent future failures

### Parallel Group B (After Group A)
Final optimization and validation:

7. **prompt_07_optimize_discovery_rate.md** - Scale to meet targets
8. **prompt_08_integration_test_fixes.md** - Validate complete system

## Performance Targets

### Before Sprint 8
- Domains extracted: 27/week (86% below target)
- Test pass rate: 43%
- Worker uptime: 0% (404 errors)
- Job execution rate: 0%
- Development environment: Fragmented (7+ processes)

### After Sprint 8
- Domains extracted: 200-500/week (MVP target met)
- Test pass rate: 100%  
- Worker uptime: 99%+
- Job execution rate: 100% (every 10 minutes)
- Development environment: Single clean process

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: 7-18x increase in domain extraction rate
- **Quality**: Zero test failures, 70%+ domain precision
- **Reliability**: Continuous operation without manual intervention
- **Monitoring**: Proactive alerts for any degradation

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
- **Database Changes**: Schema fixes could break existing data
- **Job Configuration**: Incorrect setup could cause infinite loops
- **Rate Limiting**: Optimization could trigger TikTok blocks
- **Parallel Execution**: Race conditions in concurrent tasks

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Commits**: Commit after each successful fix
- **Rollback Procedures**: Document undo steps for each change
- **Testing Validation**: Run tests after each major change
- **Monitoring**: Watch system health during optimization

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Environment Requirements
- Supabase database accessible
- Railway worker deployment configured
- Inngest account and API keys
- Redis instance for rate limiting
- Slack webhook for alerts

### Access Requirements
- Admin access to Supabase project
- Railway deployment permissions  
- Inngest dashboard access
- Database migration capabilities

## Execution Time Estimates

### With Sequential Execution
- **Total Duration**: 6-8 hours
- **Critical Path**: Prompts 1-4 (3-4 hours)
- **Optimization**: Prompts 5-8 (3-4 hours)

### With Parallel Execution (Recommended)
- **Total Duration**: 3-4 hours
- **Parallelization**: 4 simultaneous windows
- **Time Savings**: 50-60% reduction
- **Resource Requirements**: 4 development windows

## Post-Sprint Validation

### Immediate Verification (Within 1 Hour)
- [ ] Discovery job triggers and completes successfully
- [ ] Worker endpoints respond with 200 status
- [ ] New domains appear in database
- [ ] UI displays fresh data correctly
- [ ] No error logs or warnings

### Sustained Performance (24-48 Hours)
- [ ] Consistent domain extraction rate ≥200/week
- [ ] Job execution every 10 minutes without failures

- [ ] Domain extraction precision ≥70%
- [ ] No false positive patterns identified
- [ ] Performance targets sustained
- [ ] No manual intervention required
- [ ] Team confidence in system reliability

## Recovery Procedures

If sprint fails or creates new issues:

### Immediate Rollback
1. **Database**: Restore from pre-sprint backup
2. **Code**: Revert to last stable commit  
3. **Jobs**: Disable all Inngest triggers
4. **Worker**: Scale down to prevent damage

### Progressive Recovery
1. **Start Simple**: Fix one issue at a time
2. **Test Incrementally**: Validate each small change
3. **Monitor Closely**: Watch for new issues
4. **Document Everything**: Track what works/fails

- Monitoring alerts operational
- Team confident in system reliability

### Yellow Light (Partial Success)
- Most critical issues resolved (prompts 1-4)

- Performance improved but not optimal
- System functional but needs monitoring

### Red Light (Sprint Failed)
- Critical infrastructure issues remain
- Test failures persist above 10%
- Data pipeline still stalled
- System requires emergency intervention

## Communication Plan

### Sprint Start
- [ ] Notify team of maintenance window
- [ ] Communicate expected downtime
- [ ] Share progress tracking method

### During Sprint  
- [ ] Commit messages document each fix
- [ ] Update team on major milestones
- [ ] Escalate if critical issues discovered

### Sprint Complete
- [ ] Share final performance metrics
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update system documentation
- [ ] Schedule follow-up review

## Conclusion

Sprint 8 is a critical recovery sprint addressing fundamental system failures. Success restores the TikTok Domain Harvester to MVP functionality and puts the project back on track for production deployment.

The 8-prompt structure balances urgency with systematic problem-solving, ensuring each fix is validated before proceeding. Parallel execution opportunities reduce total time while managing risk through careful dependency analysis.

**Priority**: Execute prompts 1-4 immediately to restore basic functionality, then optimize with prompts 5-8 for performance and reliability.
