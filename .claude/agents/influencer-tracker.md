```typescript
interface Influencer {
  username: string;

    tiktok_id VARCHAR(100),
    follower_count INTEGER,
    verified BOOLEAN,
    niche VARCHAR(50)[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE creator_mention (
    creator_id UUID REFERENCES creator(id),
    domain_id UUID REFERENCES domain(id),
    video_id VARCHAR(100),

    score += creator.engagement_rate * 50
    score += creator.domain_diversity * 20
    score += creator.authenticity_score * 30
    return min(score, 100)  # 0-100 scale
```

        'creators': creator_list,
        'start_date': date,
