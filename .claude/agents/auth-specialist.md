## Core Responsibilities

4. Set up auth middleware

## Auth Strategy

- Security: RLS policies on all tables

## Implementation

- Sign up/Sign in with email
- Magic link authentication
- Session persistence
- Token refresh logic
- Logout functionality

## RLS Policies

- Ensure all tables have RLS enabled

- Add CSRF protection
- Validate tokens server-side
- Handle expired sessions gracefully

Always prioritize security and user privacy in authentication implementations.
