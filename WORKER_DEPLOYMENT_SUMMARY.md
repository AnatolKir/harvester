# Worker Deployment Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Worker Health Endpoints Implementation

- Added `/health`, `/ready`, `/live`, and `/metrics` endpoints
- Added test endpoints `/discover` and `/harvest` for functionality testing
- Health check server runs on configurable port (default 8080)

### 2. ✅ Deployment Configuration

- Created `railway.json` with worker service configuration
- Created `worker/railway.toml` for Railway-specific settings
- Dockerfile already configured with health checks
- Created `.env.railway.example` template for environment variables

### 3. ✅ Environment Variables Setup

#### For Local Development (`.env.local`):

```bash
HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true
HEALTH_CHECK_PORT=3001
RATE_LIMIT_BYPASS=true  # Skip Redis locally
```

#### For Railway Production:

```bash
HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true
HEALTH_CHECK_PORT=8080
# Plus all Supabase and Redis credentials
```

## Deployment Steps for Railway

1. **Install Railway CLI** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   brew install railway
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**:

   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Create new project or link existing**:

   ```bash
   railway link
   ```

4. **Set environment variables in Railway dashboard**:
   - SUPABASE_URL
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
   - UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
   - UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
   - HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true
   - HEALTH_CHECK_PORT=8080

5. **Deploy the worker**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

## Health Check Endpoints

Once deployed, the following endpoints will be available:

- `GET /health` - Overall health status
- `GET /ready` - Readiness check (database, Redis connections)
- `GET /live` - Liveness check (basic server response)
- `GET /metrics` - Performance metrics
- `POST /discover` - Test video discovery (mock data)
- `POST /harvest` - Test comment harvesting with domain extraction

## Monitoring

Railway will automatically:

- Monitor the `/health` endpoint
- Restart the container if health checks fail (max 3 retries)
- Show health status in the Railway dashboard

## Files Created/Modified

- `railway.json` - Main Railway configuration
- `worker/railway.toml` - Worker-specific Railway config
- `.env.railway.example` - Environment variable template
- `worker/health.py` - Added discovery and harvest test endpoints

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Railway using the steps above
2. Verify health endpoints are accessible
3. Monitor logs in Railway dashboard
4. Test discovery and harvest endpoints with real data
5. Set up Inngest to call worker endpoints on schedule
