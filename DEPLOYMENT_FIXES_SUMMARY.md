# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Railway Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Single-service configuration format causing "Dockerfile 'Dockerfile' does not exist" error
**Solution**: Updated `/railway.json` to use services wrapper structure:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "services": {
    "worker": {
      "root": "worker",
      "build": {
        "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
        "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
      },
      "deploy": {
        "startCommand": "python main.py",
        "healthcheckPath": "/health",
        "healthcheckTimeout": 30,
        "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
        "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Git Build Artifacts ✅
**Problem**: `.next` directory (7.8MB) accidentally committed to git
**Solution**: 
- Removed `.next` directory from git tracking
- Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive exclusions

### 3. Gitignore Improvements ✅
**Problem**: Minimal `.gitignore` missing important exclusions
**Solution**: Added comprehensive patterns for:
- Build outputs (`.next/`, `out/`, `dist/`)
- Environment files (`.env*`)
- Cache directories
- OS-specific files
- Development artifacts
- Test reports

### 4. Monorepo Structure ✅
**Problem**: Missing root `package.json` for proper monorepo detection
**Solution**: Added `/package.json` with:
- Workspace definitions for `web` and `inngest`
- Common scripts for development and deployment
- Proper metadata and dependencies

### 5. Vercel Configuration ✅
**Problem**: None (already correctly configured)
**Current**: 
```json
{
  "rootDirectory": "web",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

## Expected Results

### Railway Deployment
- Should now successfully deploy from `worker/` directory
- Will use `worker/Dockerfile` for container build
- Health checks available at `/health` endpoint
- Python worker will start with `python main.py`

### Vercel Deployment  
- Should continue deploying from `web/` directory
- Next.js app will build and deploy normally
- No changes to existing functionality

### Git Repository
- `.next` build directory no longer tracked
- Cleaner repository with proper exclusions
- Better developer experience with comprehensive `.gitignore`

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy web frontend to Vercel
make deploy-web
# or: cd web && vercel --prod

# Deploy worker to Railway  
make deploy-worker
# or: railway up

# Local development
make dev          # Run Next.js dev server
make worker       # Run Python worker locally
```

## Files Modified

- `/railway.json` - Fixed services wrapper structure
- `/.gitignore` - Comprehensive build/env exclusions  
- `/package.json` - Added root monorepo configuration
- Removed: `/.next/` directory and all build artifacts

## Next Steps

1. Test Railway deployment with new configuration
2. Verify Vercel deployment still works
3. Confirm health checks are accessible
4. Monitor deployment logs for any issues

The deployment configurations should now work reliably for both platforms.
