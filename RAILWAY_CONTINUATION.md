# Railway Deployment Issue - Continuation Prompt

## Current Status
- **Vercel**: ✅ Successfully deployed (fixed TypeScript errors)
- **Railway**: ❌ Still failing with "Dockerfile 'Dockerfile' does not exist"

## Repository Structure
```
/harvester (root)
├── /web          # Next.js frontend (Vercel) 
├── /worker       # Python worker with Dockerfile (Railway)
│   └── Dockerfile  # EXISTS but Railway can't find it
├── /inngest      # Job scheduling
├── /supabase     # Database migrations
└── package.json  # Root package file (added during troubleshooting)
```

## What We've Tried

### 1. Railway.json Configurations (ALL FAILED)
```json
// Attempt 1: Services wrapper (like working commit ba35b11)
{
  "services": {
    "worker": {
      "root": "worker",
      "build": {
        "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
        "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
      }
    }
  }
}

// Attempt 2: Direct config with relative path
{
  "root": "worker",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  }
}

// Attempt 3: Full path from root
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "worker/Dockerfile"
  }
}

// Current: Removed railway.json entirely
// Railway seems to ignore the config file
```

### 2. Other Attempts
- Added root package.json for monorepo detection
- Cleaned up .gitignore and removed .next from git
- Verified Dockerfile exists at worker/Dockerfile

## Railway Error Details
- Consistent error: "Dockerfile 'Dockerfile' does not exist"
- Railway appears to be looking in root directory, not worker/
- Railway.json configuration seems to be ignored

## What Needs Investigation

1. **Railway Dashboard Settings**
   - Check if there's a root directory setting in Railway dashboard
   - Check if Railway is set to "monorepo" mode
   - Check build settings override

2. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Move Dockerfile to root with WORKDIR /worker
   - Use Railway CLI instead of GitHub integration
   - Create a separate repository just for worker

3. **Railway-specific Files**
   - Check if Railway needs a .railwayignore file
   - Check if Railway needs specific environment variables
   - Check Railway's monorepo documentation

## Important Files

### worker/Dockerfile (EXISTS)
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.48.0-focal
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
RUN playwright install chromium
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3001
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

## Request for Next Session
Please help resolve Railway deployment. The Dockerfile exists at worker/Dockerfile but Railway can't find it. Config file appears to be ignored. Need to either:
1. Fix Railway configuration to find the Dockerfile
2. Restructure the repository for Railway compatibility
3. Find alternative deployment solution for the Python worker
